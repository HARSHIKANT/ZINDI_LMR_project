# ZINDI_LMR_project
LMR- Location mentioned Recognization, is used for tracting data from X API(micro blogs) for sending help in emergency condition to that specific location.
The location mentions (LMs) are defined as specific geo-point (e.g., school), geo-lines (e.g., street), or geo-areas (e.g., city). Addresses (e.g., Rue de Rivoli, Paris, France) and location expressions (e.g., 10km away from Paris) are not location mentions.
